I am a PhD candidate in the [gradudate school of Informatics](https://www.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/) at [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en), funded by the Japanese Government (MEXT) Scholarship. I am working in the [Human-Robot Interaction Lab](https://www.robot.soc.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/), supervised by Prof. [Takayuki Kanda](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=BL9EACgAAAAJ). My research mainly focuses on human-robot interaction, and social robotics.
